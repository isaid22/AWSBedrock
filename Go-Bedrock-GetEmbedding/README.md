## Get Embedding using Go

This example demonstrates how to use `go` to make an API call to an embedding model hosted in AWS Bedrock. The workflow is as follow:

1. Build the module. 

```go
go mod init example/get-embedding
```

This creates a module and `go.sum` and `go.mod`. 

2. Compile the code.

```go
go build -o get-embedding get-embedding.go
```

3. Run the compiled program with a text input.

```go
./get-embedding 'Now is the time'
```

and expect to see:

```
embedding vector from LLM
 [0.427734375 -0.22265625 -0.259765625 -0.01263427734375
 ...
generated embedding for input - Now is the time
generated vector length - 1536
Bedrock model call took: 101.214373ms
Unmarshal took: 535.135Âµs
```
